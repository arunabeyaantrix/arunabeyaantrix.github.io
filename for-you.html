  <h1>Hey, Beautiful ❤️</h1>
  <p>I made this little page just for you. Even though we’re far apart, you’re always close to my heart.</p>

  <button onclick="nextMessage()">Click Me</button>

  <div class="message" id="message">
    You’re my favorite person on this planet 🌍
  </div>

  <script>
    const messages = [
  "You’re my favorite person on this planet 🌍. We met through Bumble — just a few swipes, and somehow the universe brought me to you. From the very first message, you felt different. You made me smile like a fool and feel like I already knew you.",

  "The moment I saw you, something clicked. You had that spark — that glow. I don’t know how to explain it, but my heart paused for a second. In that moment, I knew I'd be thinking about you every day after.",

  "I miss you a little more every single day 🥺. It’s only been a few days, but my heart already feels full with you in it. I didn’t expect to fall this fast… but I did. I love you. Yeah — I said it. I really do.",

  "Your smile is my sunshine ☀️. Your voice is my calm place. The way you laugh, the way you say my name — it makes everything around me softer, better. You make the world feel warm again.",

  "I want to share everything with you — my life, my messy thoughts, my weird little dreams. I want to write poetry for you, cook for you (even if it’s just burnt toast and Maggi 😅), and bring you chocolates after your long days. You deserve everything sweet.",

  "I’m counting down the days till I can see you again 💕. Long distance sucks, but you make it bearable. You’re worth every kilometer, every late-night call, every sleepy morning. I’d choose this — choose you — a thousand times over.",

  "You make the distance feel like nothing 💌. Even when you’re far away, your words, your presence, your love — they stay close. You’re always with me, even when you’re not next to me.",

  "You’re not just someone I like — you’re my person. My peace. The one I want to grow with, laugh with, wake up next to, and build a life with. Always. Forever. No matter what. ❤️"
